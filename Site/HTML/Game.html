		<h1>Synopsis</h1>
		<p = style = "text-indent: 1em">
		In Epita, nobody really knows what are the Sup'Biotech students' doing. They share
		our buildings and have labs where we assume that they're making biology experiments
		but no Epita student could actually tell what's happening there.</p>
		<p = style = "text-indent: 1em">
		One day, an Epitean wakes up in the yard. He's lost. The school is usually crowded
		with students even in the middle of the night. However, since he woke up, noone is
		there. Worse than this, the school is closed when it is supposed to always be opened.</p>
		<p = style = "text-indent: 1em">
		When you explore the place to find an exit, you will quickly find yourself in our
		hero's worst nightmare . The yard was empty but not the buildings... A failed
		Sup'Biotech's experiment seems to have turned every people into zombies. Survival
		becomes your new priority.</p>
		<p = style = "text-indent: 1em">
		Take control of our scared hero and help him in his quest to get away from this while
		surviving to zombie packs attacking him. Unlock and use the three weapons at your
		disposal in order to fight your way through the zombies in your way. Visit all Epita
		in your solo adventure or try to kill as mush zombies as you can in our multiplayer mode.</p>
		<p = style = "text-indent: 1em">
		You will need tenacity and courage to survive the dark but absurd universe of this game.
		Available in French as well as in English so that we can offer you a unique gaming experience.</p>
