		<h1>Origins</h1>
		
		<h3 = style="text-indent:2em">The project's origin</h3>
		<p = style = "text-indent: 1em">
			The basic idea comes from David who thought that the Epita buildings in
			Villejuif would be a great place for the development of an horror game,
			especially in the middle of the night, because of the blue lights in the
			corridors which are pretty dark on the red walls. Once the team made, and
			since the idea seemed to please everybody, we adopted this as a base for
			the project. Each member then expressed his own vision of the game during
			an intense brain-storming. The game which resulted of the different view
			point's mix. We all agreed on the creation of a survival horror game. A
			First Person Shooter played inside Epita. C# being the programming
			language learned this year the game would be coded using it. And Unity
			being put at our disposal with the obligationto use, it goes without saying
			that the game would be made on Unity.

		<h3 = style="text-indent:2em">The team's origin</h3>
		<p = style = "text-indent: 1em">
			We are a group of four men. Simple, beautiful, intelligent and very
			curious. We are in the same class so we already know each other and
			we get along pretty well which will ease the cohesion of the group
			and will allow us to provide serious, precise, rigorous and painstaking
			work. Our love for video games put us together in order to fulfil our
			destiny : to create a game on UNITY. Even if the group formed pretty
			late, we are and will stay motivated so that we can carry out this 
			ambitious project that you will discover.

			    Since I got my first Gameboy, I have always been fascinated by electronics and computer
			, but during adolescence, my vision of these systems has changed:
			I began to be more interested more in a game of how mechanicals were managed , 
			but it was hard and I always considered this stuff in a professional view, quality and 
			a level of knowledge that I had no chance to reach ; especially at the time, I intended to
			rather do research. However, systems have always interested me,
			and this is always my goal in life, to understand how things
			worked (this is also in aim that I joined Evolutek).
			I became interested in programming in third year of secondary, seeing the
			possibilities of the friends' of my brother calculators, I wanted to do the same.
			After having mastered the IT language, I put myself in Java, first amateur and then 
			I took a programming module in my American school where I could deepen this knowledge,
			and understand object-oriented programming. JBut I had never tried a another language before 
			arriving at EPITA so I discovered the joys of the imperative with Caml; However, C# is much
			closer to Java than any other languages, I hope it will give me a slight advantage
			for the project.

			    Since childhood, I was interested in artificial intelligence, thanks to movies 
			or science-fiction books. C'est
			That's why, I oriented myself to computers in high school..  I have
			started programming terminal with ISN specialty. It was where I
			able to confirm my interest in computer science. In ISN I learned Java, the
			HTML and CSS and I participated in two group projects, one consisting
			to create a website and the second to code a card game on console,
			in Java.  Being very excited about what I was learning, I decided
			entering Epita order to go further in this area (and perhaps
			one day finally create Hal9000).This project is an opportunity to set
			practice what I learn this year. I also hope to improve my
			knowledge and acquire a good working group experience. Being
			chosen as project manager, I intend also to improve my domination skills
			of feeble minds which will be helpful in my future life.

			    I got my first computer at the age of 7 years. At first I saw
			as a substitute for television, but I realized that with the Internet, the computer
			was actually a great tool to play and entertain me. When I grew up, I realized
			the potential of the computer and its usefulness. It always fascinated by its
			hidden complexity and its logic My interest for IT has increased especially during 
			my 10th grade year when we learned a little algorithmic in maths class.
			was confirmed during the 11th grade when my cousin and a former graduate EPITA have encouraged
			me to pursue studies in this field. Then, I interested myself in the C ++ language.  
			I have found it was complicated but I acquired vocabulary and theoretical knowledge 
			even if I have coded a few. So I enterred to EPITA.  The project is for me
			a great opportunity to deepen our knowledge in computer
			and discover teamwork that will be greatly helpful me in my
			career.

			    Well, this is the first time for me ( a deflowering ...). Before
			enterred EPITA , I had never coded my life , but I know how to use
			a computer for a long time ( kindergarten , good time!) .
			In short, it will amaze you, but IT is not my greatest passion .
			Je préfère avant tous la musique, plus précisement tous ce qui se trouve
			entre le punk, le rock, la pop et le metal, mon groupe préféré étant Linkin
			Park (d'où le pseudo), mais là n'est pas la question. J'ai beaucoup d'attirance
			pour le monde du jeu vidéo, mes jeux préférés étant Portal (surtout le 2) et
			Deus Ex (celui de 2000). Comme je suis (je pense) le plus novice en matière
			de codage dans le groupe, j'espère ne pas me transformer en boulet pour le
			groupe, et ma grande motivation va beaucoup m'aider...
