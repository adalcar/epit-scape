		Yeah. We know you want it. In our great generosity, we are putting to your disposal
		t-shirts to the effigy of our development studio. It's true. You're not dreaming ! You too will
		now be able to look ridiculous in every circumstances. Customize your t-shirt by putting on it
		your own pseudo so you can look much more SWAG. You can even have your pseudo in <I>BRAILLE</I>
		on one of your sleeves ! Establish your domination with their yellow colour which will have the
		double effect of diverting the attention away from the many imperfections on your face AND will
		burn people's eyes around you. Look at that, they are purely <I>sublime</I>.</p>
